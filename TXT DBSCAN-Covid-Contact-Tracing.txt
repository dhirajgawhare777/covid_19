Live Data Clustering and Analysis
This repository contains Python code for clustering and analyzing live location data using the DBSCAN algorithm. The code reads live location data from a JSON file, applies DBSCAN for clustering, and visualizes the results.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Required libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine.

Install the required libraries if not already installed:

Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Run the Python script live_data_analysis.py.

Usage
The script reads live location data from livedata.json and saves it as livedata.csv.

It visualizes the data distribution using KDE plots and cluster scatterplots.

DBSCAN clustering is applied to the data using specified parameters.

The clustered data is saved as clustered.csv.

Infected nodes related to a given name can be identified using the get_infected_names() function.

Results
The script outputs visualizations that help understand the distribution and clusters within the live location data.

Clustered data is saved in clustered.csv.

Notes
Ensure that livedata.json is in the same directory as the script.

Adjust DBSCAN parameters (eps, min_samples) for optimal clustering based on your data.

This script provides basic insights into live data clustering; customize it to your specific needs.
